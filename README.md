# FTC 2021
**Team ID: 14413**

## how to edit

**download the FTC source code for freight frenzy and copy these files into teamCode.**
- note that they will not run without a control hub hooked up to your Windows-emulated device. 

## files

1. TestOP - robot code that works
- makes the robot move forward, backwards, strafe, and rotate
2. testing - newer additions that haven't been tested
- delivery system, linear slide, duck wheel, etc.

## i would love your help!

check the team discord for an ongoing list of programming projects that still need completion.
even without the control hub there's plenty of research and coding to be done!
